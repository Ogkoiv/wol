# Wake-on-LAN Magic Packet Sender

This small Python script sends Wake-on-LAN (WoL) magic packets to wake up devices on your home network. You can define the target MAC addresses directly in the code or pass them as command-line arguments using `:` as separators.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Python script (`wol_sender.py`) in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).
3. In the script, find the `mac_addresses` variable and add the MAC addresses of the target devices as a list.
4. Save the changes.
5. Run the script.

### Option 2: Pass MAC Addresses as Command-Line Arguments

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script with the MAC addresses as command-line arguments. Use `:` as separators between MAC addresses.
